*** THIS IS UNMAINTAINED. ***

I use it, and it works (worked?), but its from 2009 please do not
submit bug reports. The code is ugly, I know. 

================================
Outlets PDU Manager - README
================================

1.0 Requirements
A webserver
php 5.2
php5-snmp module

1.1 Installation
Copy this directory and all of its contents to somewhere on your webserver's 
DocumentRoot. Make sure you have php5-snmp installed. I would also suggest 
installing the command line snmp tools for debugging as you configure Outlets. 

The default login is:
Username: admin
Password: admin

1.2 Configuration
See the config.php file for details on configuring Outlets. The config layout 
is fairly simple, easy to read and well documented. The toughest part will be 
figuring out the OIDs. You can use numeric or textual, I really only had numeric
available to me when I wrote this. 

Use snmpwalk and copious amounts of guess-work when figuring out OIDs. Also note
that some PDUs will present their data in multiple OIDs, some writable, some 
not. Look for patterns and such. For example, if you have a 24 port PDU, and all
of the outlets are ON, and you see 24 1's or 0's in a row, well that might be 
your outlet status. I've added a couple for the APC and Tripplite models I use.

2.0 Usage
Usage of Outlets is fairly straight forward. To change the name of an outlet 
simply click its name, and enter the new value. Press enter to confirm or esc to
cancel. Outlets can be switched on or off by clicking the status and selecting
the desired status from the drop down, then clicking OK. The interface was 
created with jQuery uses AJAX to read/write data.
